## Save The Time

Save the time is a very minimalistic clone of the game concept behind [Save the Day](https://ga.me/games/save-the-day). The entire game was coded in 3 hours, including the design of assets using [Boxy SVG Editor](https://boxy-svg.com/).

The game was developed on [ct.js](https://ctjs.rocks/).

The game lacks many functionalities on the original game including gameplay animations, particles and effects, sounds / music, and general gameplay aroma. All these features require significant development time. This is just meant to be a proof of concept for a very small subset of the functionality.

## Process

Done within 3 hours:

* Manual Design of Helicopter assets.
* Manual Design of Small and Large Platform assets.
* Manual Design of the Drop Point Platform.
* Game Design with Assets on ct.js.

## Credits

* [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/toon-characters-1) for the Toon Character Asset.
* Green Background by [MadFire](https://swapnilrane24.itch.io/) for Game Background Image.
